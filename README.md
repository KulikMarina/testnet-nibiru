**Nibiru** Chain is a proof-of-stake blockchain and member of a family of interconnected blockchains that comprise the Cosmos Ecosystem. Nibiru powers three main decentralized applications:
- **Nibi**-Perps - Perpetuals Exchange: On the perps exchange, users can take leveraged exposure and trade on a plethora of assets: completely on-chain, completely non-custodially, and with minimal gas fees.
- **Nibi-Swap** - Spot AMM: An automated market maker for multichain assets. This application gives users access to swaps, pools, and bonded liquidity gauges.
- **NUSD Stablecoin**: Nibiru employs a two-token economic model, where NIBI is the governance and utility token for the protocol and NUSD is a capital-efficient, partially collateralized algorithmic stablecoin created by the protocol.

Nibiru is built with the [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), accurately prices assets using a system of decentralized oracles, and communicates with other Cosmos layer-1 chains using the [Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc).
